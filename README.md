# Bobo

Bobo is a platform that allows parents to monitor the growth and development of their baby. The application provides features to log milestones,
get reasearch based expert advice and nutrition guides based on the baby's age. Additionally, there is a forum and a marketplace for users to interact and exchange baby items.
Also included is an advanced AI chatbot to offer quick chat with user.

This application is developed using Django, a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
Our database of choice is MySQL, a widely-used, reliable, and robust relational database management system.

The application is still at an early stage;
At the current stage, we have successfully created a Django project implemented user registration and authentication. Users can sign up, log in, and navigate to the home page. 
All passwords are securely hashed for storage, ensuring user privacy and security.

## Setup : coming soon

## Features
User Registration: Users can sign up by providing their email and creating a password.
User Authentication: Users can log in using their email and password.

## Testing
You can test the application by creating a new user, logging in, and navigating to the home page. More comprehensive tests will be added as more features are implemented.
